  "aboutpara": "My fascination for programming began in my formative years and ever since has shaped my career and personal interests. It lead me to earn a Bachelor of Science and an Honours in Computer Science from the University of Cape Town, with a focus on computer games development. Additionally, it drove me to involve myself in the construction of software applications in various domains, such as video games, 3D software, web, and AI. I have published a paper on applying evolutionary algorithms to automate deep neural network parameter optimization, and I often contribute to video game hackathons. I thrive on challenges that sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge, particularly in collaborative environments where I can contribute to solving complex problems. I am committed to continuous learning and actively explore new technologies and advance my expertise whenever i get the oppertunity to do so. Looking forward, I am eager to bring my blend of experience, drive, and proven impact to any position I undertake."
